### Introduction:

Today I wanted to review "Arctic Fortress Protocol" (a tiered system for bitcoin usage and custody) after Twitter/X user [Bitcoin Reef](https://twitter.com/BtcCuracao "https://twitter.com/BtcCuracao") requested feedback on it. If you would like to explore Arctic Fortress for yourself, you can find its website at [www.arctivefortress.com](https://arcticfortress.com/ "https://arcticfortress.com/").

### Video Notes:

Level 1: Lightning Network

I like the focus on on-boarding newbies to LN first. While I am somewhat torn on referring them to custodial services, I cannot argue with the fact that present non-custodial LN wallets present certain roadblocks, (complexity, channel fees, etc.), that may discourage new users. [5:11]

Level 2: Welcome to the Timechain

I appreciate the focus on getting users set up with a steel seed phrase backup as soon as they are onboarded onto L1 (on-chain) bitcoin.

Level 3: Keep Your Savings Off Your Person

An important next step. Any user with substantial (for them) on-chain holdings should be storing it in a way that is not on their person at all times. I appreciate the point of not installing non-Bitcoin applications on the "cold storage" phone. [7:37]

Level 4: Multi-sig Custody and Geographic Distribution

I really like the way they've broke down and laid out the process of creating a multi-signature cold storage setup. Laying out the geographic distribution of keys and the benefit of human contact during multi-signature signing as a protective measure when under duress was an addition that I really appreciated.

### My Takes:

Overall, I think they've done a fantastic job with this guide. Both in terms of how neatly they've broken down bitcoin use into 4 logical levels of complexity and security, as well as the clarity with which they lay out the process for following these steps.

I am typically not a fan of 2 of 2 multi-sig setups, but the way they stressed having multiple copies of the seed material in different locations put my mind at ease.

### Suggestions:

Seed Backups: I question the sole recommendation of the CryptoSteel Capsule, due to the high cost of the device (~$450 for the recommended 6), but understand it to be a backup solution of relatively high quality. I would like to see a few other lower priced recommendations (obviously only if they actually would choose to recommend them), or a DIY solution like the [BlockMit](https://blockmit.com/english/guides/diy/make-cold-wallet-washers/ "https://blockmit.com/english/guides/diy/make-cold-wallet-washers/") washer stamping jig (sold [<HERE>](https://www.cryptocloaks.com/product/blockmitjig/ "https://www.cryptocloaks.com/product/blockmitjig/") by [CryptoCloaks](https://www.cryptocloaks.com/ "https://www.cryptocloaks.com/")). [6:05]

Multisig Configuration File Redundant Backups: I think you did well in touching on the importance of backup of the multi-sig configuration file, though I would ideally like to see the configuration file stored redundantly in another format that isn't just on the phones used. Perhaps a printed copy from a non-internet connected printer could be stored alongside the CryptoSteel Capsule in the safety deposit box or in the "work office" location?

### Final Notes:

I'm a somewhat advanced Bitcoin user. I run my node, roll my own seeds with dice and paper, create my own seed backups, etc. Additionally, I really like signing devices (hardware wallets).

While much of this is just best practice, I will be the first to admit that some elements of my security setup are excessively complex and driven by my own situation and preferences. My setup is by no means what brand new users should be attempting to emulate right off the bat.

There is no one-size-fits-all for bitcoin custody, but I think you've done a commendable job of laying out a good system with varying levels of complexity that allow a new user to comfortably dip their toes in, while giving them the freedom to evolve their setup as their confidence, understanding, and bitcoin holdings grow.
